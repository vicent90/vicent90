## 👋 I'm Vicente — Tech Enthusiast, Dog Dad & Fitness Buff

Curiosity drives me to learn new things and explore how technology can solve real-world challenges. I'm always excited to dive into the latest tech trends.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably chilling with my two huskies 🐺🐺, hitting some shots on the padel or tennis court 🎾, lifting at the gym 🏋️ or practicing some calisthenics 🤸‍♂️.
